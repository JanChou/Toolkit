SharpDX is an open-source project delivering the full DirectX API under the .Net platform, allowing the development of high performance game, 2D and 3D graphics rendering as well as realtime sound application.

SharpDX is built with a custom tool called SharpGen able to generate automatically a .NET API directly from the DirectX SDK headers, thus allowing a tight mapping with the native API while taking advantages of the great strength of the .Net ecosystem.

SharpDX is fully supporting all Windows platforms including latest Windows 8 Metro and Windows Phone 8. Easily develop multimedia applications for desktop, WinRT and Windows Phone with the same API!
