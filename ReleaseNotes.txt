 * Direct3D10/11
    - Add Equals method to InputElement
	- Remove result check from Device.CheckFormatSupport. Add None value to FormatSupport. 
 * Direct3D11
    - Add optimized methods for DeviceContext.CommonShaderStage.SetSampler(s)/SetShaderResource(s)/SetConstantBuffer(s)
    - Add MultiCube sample for multithreading and deferred context benchmark. See http://code4k.blogspot.com/2011/11/direct3d11-multithreading-micro.html
    - Use a common pattern for Texture1D, Texture2D, Texture3D constructors 
	- Add DeviceContext.IsAvailableData for Begin/End Query statistics. Add new GetData method.
	- Add method DeviceContext.OutputMerger.ResetTargets to unset all binded Targets
 * Direct2D1
    - Move Matrix3x2 from Direct2D to SharpDX core assembly
 * DirectInput
