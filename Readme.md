Official web site: [sharpdx.org](http://sharpdx.org)

This is a high-level API around DirectX, called the Toolkit for SharpDX. The Toolkit is deprecated and is no longer supported.

> # Warning
> The current code of the Toolkit in this repository is no longer working with the latest branch of SharpDX. We need to work on cleaning/test/upgrade to the latest version of SharpDX.
